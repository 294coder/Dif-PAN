ALTERNATIVE WAY OF GETTING TO SOFTWARE AND REPORTS
(THIS MIGHT BE DISCONTINUED SINCE IT IS NOT ROBUST):
     It can also be obtained (usually) with the following command on unix systems:

     %telnet dsp.rice.edu 5555 |sed '1,3d' | csh -fbs software
 OR  %telnet 128.42.4.62 5555 |sed '1,3d' | csh -fbs software

You probably want to add

	alias riceget "telnet 128.42.4.62 5555 |sed '1,3d' | csh -fsb"

so that you can access the distribution (which will hopefully be updated periodically)

	%riceget OPTIONS

where options is a list of options. 

	%riceget help

would return all options currently available.
